# Hey! I'm Alberto Cárdenas (Beto Alien) 👋

I'm a **Data Engineer** from Mexico. 🇲🇽  
I currently live in Texas, USA. 🇺🇸

I created **PardoX** and I'm currently working on many exciting ideas. 🚀

I'm usually coding with **Python** and **JavaScript**, I've been working with and learning **Rust** for a while now, and I'll never leave **PHP** since it was my first love. 💻
